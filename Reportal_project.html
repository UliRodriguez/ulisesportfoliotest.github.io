									<h3 class="major">I developed a web-based self-service tool for sale representatives to easily lookup account information using SQL.</h3>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Reportal Account Lookup_censored.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>In this project, my team asked me to build a reporting tool that would help pull information regarding sales reps and client book mappings. For context, at the start of each fiscal half at the company, our department has a two-week to a month-long process to remap client books to the right sales rep. The tool I created would assist in identifying mapping discrepancies after the process was completed.</p>
									<p>In the code above, the user can input an account ID or a list of account IDs. The program would then extract the market, the recent half, and a message stating which books is assigned to the account. If the information presented is incorrect, the user would be given instructions to contact a team depending on their issue and quickly fix the issue, avoiding submitting a ticket to my team.</p>
									
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Reportal Book Lookup_censored.png" alt="" /></div>
                                	<p>In this additional code, my team and I wanted to create a tool that would pull the record type, account type, and IDs associated with a book. The record type could be one of three options: AE (account executive), CSM (customer service manager), or CRM (customer relationship management) account. If the record type is AE, the names of sales reps and their IDs would be displayed. If it's CSM, the CSM account name and ID would display. If it's CRM, the CRM account name and ID would display. This would be another alternative to check book ownership and detect incorrect mappings.</p>
									<p>When the tool was complete, my team asked me to create a tutorial video. The tutorial was a quick step-by-step video demonstrating the types of valid inputs the user could enter and what they could expect to see when the report was sent to their email. I didn't mention the SQL code in the video because it was hidden in the background of a user-friendly UI with a description of the tool's purpose. The only action the user could take was to enter an ID number or a list of IDs.</p>

									<h4 class="major">What I learned</h4>
									<p>During the process of building this tool, I learned the importance of following coding standards for readability and maintaining the code. Also, I learned about code styles, like using common table expressions over subqueries and spacing out the code for readability as well.</p>
